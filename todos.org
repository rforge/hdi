* cleaning up
** multi split
*** OPEN-FOR-DISCUSSION *ruben* [ci investigate] how the ci calculation works, is it critical 1-ci.level %in% gamma? 
    only for duality
    the ci ignores the gamma range and just takes the empirical quantiles
    coming from the splits
    therefore,  if the p-values are calculated by the aggregation from the
    gamma range -> duality is lost
    + p-values are calculated by interpolation (which is not the biggest issue)
*** DONE *ruben* [ci investigate]Can we handle ci.level < 0.05 at all if gamma.min = 0.05?
    yes, no issue here
*** OPEN-FOR-DISCUSSION *ruben* [ci] gamma create better default option multisplit
*** TODO *ruben* *low priority* [hierarchical - speed F test] speed up the lm fits without formula notation, FIXME of martin
*** DONE *ruben* [sanity check output classical.fit] no NA [ ] is length correct [ ] are all p-values >=0 and <=1 [ ]
*** DONE *ruben* [glmnet sample size] fix warning glmnet too small sample size
    example: take any design matrix with < 20 samples and apply cv.glmnet
    
    it reports that it cannot do grouped=FALSE
*** TODO *lukas* [lm.pval] catch perfect fit Warning, give user useful message
** generate datasets
*** DONE *ruben* [save restore RNGstate] look at stats:::simulate.lm for good practice
*** DONE *ruben* [rename] the functions to rXbeta and rX, Use *etags* in shell and then emacs to rename over all fcts
*** DONE *ruben* [set default iteration=NA]
*** DONE *ruben* [useful message if iteration != NA] "overriding current RNG state with seed, restoring original RNG state after data generation"
*** DONE *ruben* [warn iteration !in 1:50] allow the iteration to be outside that range but warn that this is not a design from the paper anymore
*** DONE *ruben* [export rX] also export rX
*** DONE *ruben* [man pages] update the man pages
*** DONE *ruben* [man page rX] to be added
** lowerbound
*** TODO *lukas* lowerBound error n > 50
*** TODO *lukas* fix seed issues (see comments Martin)
** everywhere
*** TODO *lukas* add more dput comparisons to test files
*** OPEN-FOR-DISCUSSION *ruben* *but confint.hdi already exists in methods.R!!!* [calc.ci function] (use the helpers.R function as well) return a calculate ci function everywhere s.t. no need to recalc whole fit to get different ci level
*** DONE *lukas* [parallel default] ncores default change to default of multisplit, as in mcmapply
*** DONE *lukas* replace print("abc") etc. with cat("abc")
*** DONE *lukas* [message] replace everywhere cat and print with message if not within verbose
*** DONE *lukas* [DESCRIPTION] change to new author system, see Markus pcalg
*** DONE *lukas* use everywhere the same name for verbose / trace etc. Keep silent!
